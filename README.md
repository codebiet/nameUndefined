### **Overview**

This Platform provides a better, simpler, and secure way to conduct online tests/quizzes.

The basic functionalities of the Platform are mentioned below:



1. **Create Test**: In This Section, and that too in just a few steps.
2. **Take Test**: Currently going on tests/quizzes can be taken here by providing us the test id.
3. **Dashboard**: Here all the previous tests which user have taken or created can be seen.

### **Inspiration**

In the wake of the Corona pandemic, our college had decided to take online class tests on [google forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/). But our team believed it doesn’t make any sense to take tests on [google forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/) due to following reasons:



1. Since all the questions on google form will appear at once, so candidates can cheat very easily.
2. Above problem can be removed by making multi-pages forms but even then candidates cheat since multi form pages cannot be randomized.
3. Candidates will have to restart the test in case of any technical failures like loss of net connectivity etc.

So, we decided to develop this platform which will provide all the basic facilities that google form provides with some additional features to avoid above vulnerabilities and those features are discussed below.

### **Features**



*   This app has minimalistic UI so that  non-tech users will not have much problems to conduct tests.
*   Questions will appear one-by-one and that too for a fixed time provided by the creator of the test after that it will be submitted automatically.
*   All the questions will be randomly given to candidates so, it will be very rare that two friends get the same question at a given instance of time.
*   In case of any failure candidates can restart the test from where they left off i.e. they don’t have to resubmit previously submitted questions.

### **Where TestMania lack’s**



*   This App doesn’t have any feature that restricts candidates to use online/offline material. So we believe that this platform best suites for Open text book based tests.
*   As of now testmania supports only text content in question i.e. a question cannot have image or any other media.

We will try to solve these issues in further versions.
